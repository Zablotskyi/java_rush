I would like to get columns from two spreadsheets(named After and Before) and subtract the values of one sheet from the
other and store the results in a third sheet. However the sheet After could have new columns added, as shown in second
image where the columns are sorted in alphabetical order by state name. Some pseudo code I wrote looks like:

Get After's data as an object
Get Before's data as an object
For each column x in After, starting in column B
    For each column y in Before
        'check if columns have same header name'
        if After.x1 = Before.y1 
           subtract column values
           end loop
